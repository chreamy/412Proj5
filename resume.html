                Areas of Interest in Computer Science
              </h2>
              <p>
                My passion for Computer Science is driven by the following
                areas:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong>: Fascinated by the
                  potential of AI to revolutionize industries and improve
                  everyday life. Particularly interested in natural language
                  processing and its applications in creating smarter chatbots
                  and virtual assistants.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Cloud Computing</strong>: Interested in cloud
                  infrastructure and its role in scaling applications
                  efficiently. Keen on learning more about AWS and Azure.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Cryptocurrencies and NFTs</strong>: The rise of
                  cryptocurrencies and NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) has opened new
                  avenues in digital ownership and investment. I am keen on
                  exploring how these digital assets continue to evolve and

          My name is Christopher Liu, and I'm presently immersed in the
          challenging and rewarding world of Computer Science as a student at
          Texas A&M University. My academic and project experiences span across
          a diverse range of disciplines within technology, including full-stack
          development, machine learning, and human-computer interaction. This
          broad exposure has not only honed my technical skills but also
          nurtured a deep understanding of the intricate ways in which users
          interact with technology, driving my passion for creating intuitive
          and impactful digital experiences. As I navigate through my academic
          journey, I am eagerly seeking opportunities to apply my skills in a
          practical setting through a Software Engineering (SWE) internship in
          the summer of 2024. I bring to the table a robust set of capabilities
          as an experienced programmer, underscored by my ability to rapidly
          assimilate new information and technologies. My background in
          full-stack development equips me with a comprehensive understanding of
          software development life cycles, from conceptualization to
          deployment, ensuring I can contribute effectively to projects right
          from the start. Moreover, my experiences in machine learning projects
          have provided me with a solid foundation in data analysis and
          algorithm development, enabling me to tackle complex problems with
          innovative solutions. My keen interest in human-computer interaction
          drives my approach to development, always with a focus on user-centric
          design principles. I pride myself on being a fast learner and an
          effective communicator, skills that I believe are crucial for success
          in fast-paced and collaborative environments. My goal is to leverage
          these skills in a challenging internship role, where I can contribute
          to impactful projects while continuing to grow professionally and
          technically. I am excited about the possibility of sharing more about
          my journey and exploring how my background, skills, and interests
          align with potential opportunities.
